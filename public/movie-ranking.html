<h2>I Would Highly Recommend These Movies To Any And Everyone</h2>
<hr>
<h3 style="color:red">Fight Club</h3>
<p>A hyper masculine si-fi drama that makes some strong observations about modern society</p>
<h3 style="color:gold">Django Unchained</h3>
<p>Gotta be one the best of Quinten Tarintino as he delivers one of the best action dramas starring Jamie Fox about a runaway slave becoming a bounty hunter</p>
<h3 style="color:aqua">Rocky III</h3>
<p>Definitely the most underrated rocky movie, apollo and rocky's bromance and training together is amazing and the story about hunger for success once you get it is amazing</p>
<h3 style="color:darkorange">Creed</h3>
<p>Sylvester Stallone kills it in this, simply put its amazing</p>
<h3 style="color:chartreuse">Rocky IV</h3>
<p>A rollercoaster of ride of emotions drama and solid training, gotta be the best rocky film out there</p>
